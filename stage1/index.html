        <p title="What my name is!"><!---Learned this through searching for other things :).-->My name is Daniel Brites, and I currently work for ATT. I live in South Florida. I have a beautiful family and enjoy spending time with them. I am an avid Miami Heat fan, as well as a fan to the other Miami sports. I enjoy golfing, casual gaming (not the crazy <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/">COD</a> or anything, more towards <a href="https://dishonored.bethesda.net/">Dishonored</a>), and watching shows on HBO and Netflix.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>My family consists of my beautiful wife and four beautiful girls. Their ages are 15, 13, 10 and 1. My oldest two live in Virginia, while the youngest two live in Florida. During the summers, all of the girls are together which usually ends up being a chaotic situation difficult for any mere mortal to handle...and I wouldn't trade it anything.</p>
